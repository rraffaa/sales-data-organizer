# sales-data-organizer
This project demonstrates how to clean and organize transaction data using Python. The initial data is stored in a messy string format, with various delimiters and inconsistent entries. The goal is to parse the string, split it into individual transactions, and cleanly organize the information into structured lists for easier analysis.
